### Git Branching Workflows Cheatsheet

#### Long-Running Branches Workflow:
- **Description:** Multiple branches are kept open for different stages of development.
- **Branches:**
  - **Master:** Contains only stable, released code.
  - **Develop/Next:** Used for ongoing development and testing.
  - **Feature/Topic Branches:** Short-lived branches for specific features or tasks.
- **Merge Strategy:** Regularly merge feature branches into develop/next for testing, then into master for release.

#### Topic Branches Workflow:
- **Description:** Short-lived branches created and used for specific features or tasks.
- **Creation:** 
  - Create a new branch for each feature or task.
  - Work on the branch, committing changes as necessary.
  - Delete the branch after merging it into the main branch.
- **Benefits:**
  - Allows quick context-switching between different tasks.
  - Easier code review and collaboration.
- **Example:**
  - Create a branch (e.g., iss91) for an issue.
  - Work on it, create another branch (iss91v2) for alternative solution.
  - Merge successful branches (iss91v2) into main branch and delete unused branches.

#### Considerations:
- **Local Operation:** All branching and merging operations are performed locally before pushing changes to the remote repository.
- **Workflow Customization:** Choose the workflow that best suits your project's needs and team collaboration style.
- **Distributed Git:** For more detailed workflows and collaboration strategies, refer to the Distributed Git chapter.
