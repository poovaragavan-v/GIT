### Git Branch Management Cheatsheet

#### Branch Listing:
- **List Branches:** `git branch`: Lists all local branches.
- **List Branches with Last Commit:** `git branch -v`: Shows branches with their last commit.
- **List Merged Branches:** `git branch --merged`: Displays branches merged into the current branch.
- **List Unmerged Branches:** `git branch --no-merged`: Shows branches with unmerged changes.

#### Branch Operations:
- **Create a Branch:** `git branch <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch.
- **Switch Branch:** `git checkout <branch-name>`: Moves to the specified branch.
- **Create and Switch to Branch:** `git checkout -b <branch-name>`: Creates and switches to a new branch.
- **Delete a Branch:** `git branch -d <branch-name>`: Deletes a merged branch.
- **Force Delete a Branch:** `git branch -D <branch-name>`: Deletes a branch regardless of its merge status.
- **Rename a Branch (Local):** `git branch --move <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>`: Renames a local branch.
- **Rename a Branch (Remote):** `git push --set-upstream origin <new-branch-name>`: Pushes the renamed branch to the remote repository.
- **Delete a Branch (Remote):** `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`: Deletes a branch from the remote repository.

#### Changing the Main Branch Name:
- **Rename Local Main Branch:** `git branch --move master main`: Renames the local master branch to main.
- **Push Renamed Branch to Remote:** `git push --set-upstream origin main`: Pushes the renamed branch to the remote repository.
- **Delete Old Main Branch (Remote):** `git push origin --delete master`: Deletes the old master branch from the remote repository.

#### Note:
- **Caution:** Renaming the main branch can break integrations, scripts, and configurations. Consult with collaborators and update dependencies before renaming the main branch.
- **Tasks After Renaming:** Update dependencies, configurations, scripts, and documentation referencing the old branch name.
