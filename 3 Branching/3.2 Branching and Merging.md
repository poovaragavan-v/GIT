### Basic Branching and Merging

In Git, branching and merging are fundamental operations that enable flexible development workflows. Let's summarize the basic concepts and steps involved:

#### Basic Branching:

1. **Creating a Branch:** Use `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create a new branch and switch to it simultaneously. For example:
   ```
   $ git checkout -b iss53
   ```

2. **Working on a Branch:** Make changes and commit them to the branch. This moves the branch pointer forward with each commit.

3. **Switching Branches:** Use `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch between branches. Git resets your working directory to match the state of the branch you're switching to.

#### Basic Merging:

1. **Merging Branches:** To merge changes from one branch into another, switch to the target branch and run `git merge <branch-to-merge>`. For example:
   ```
   $ git checkout master
   $ git merge iss53
   ```

2. **Resolve Merge Conflicts:** If Git encounters conflicts during the merge, it pauses the process and asks you to resolve them manually. Use `git status` to identify conflicted files, resolve conflicts in each file, and stage them using `git add`.

3. **Finalizing the Merge:** After resolving conflicts, commit the merge changes using `git commit`. Git provides a default merge commit message, but you can customize it to provide additional context about the merge resolution.

#### Additional Notes:

- **Branch Cleanup:** Once a branch has served its purpose, you can delete it using `git branch -d <branch-name>`.

- **Visual Merge Tools:** Git provides `git mergetool` for resolving merge conflicts using graphical tools.

Understanding these basic branching and merging concepts is essential for effective collaboration and version control in Git.
