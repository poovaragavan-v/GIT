### Git Rebasing Cheatsheet

#### Basics of Rebasing:
- **What is Rebasing:** Integrating changes from one branch onto another by replaying commits.
- **Command:** `git rebase <branch>`: Reapplies commits from the current branch on top of `<branch>`.
- **Purpose:** Creates a linear history, makes integration cleaner.

#### Performing a Basic Rebase:
1. **Checkout Branch:** `git checkout <branch>`
2. **Rebase onto Master:** `git rebase master`
3. **Result:** Commits from the current branch are applied on top of the master branch.

#### More Advanced Rebases:
- **Rebasing on Different Branch:** `git rebase --onto <basebranch> <sourcebranch> <destinationbranch>`
- **Example:** `git rebase --onto master server client`
- **Result:** Applies changes from `client` branch onto `master` branch.

#### Handling Rebasing Conflicts:
- **Resolve Conflicts:** Address any conflicts that arise during the rebase process.
- **Continue Rebase:** After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase process with `git rebase --continue`.

#### Best Practices and Considerations:
- **Avoid Rebasing Public Commits:** Don't rebase commits that have been shared with others.
- **Potential Issues:** Rebasing public commits can cause confusion and merge conflicts for collaborators.
- **Communication:** Ensure all team members understand the implications of rebasing and when to use it.

#### Rebasing vs. Merging:
- **Rebasing:** Creates a linear history, ideal for cleaner integration.
- **Merging:** Preserves the chronological order of commits, reflects the actual sequence of changes.
- **Choose Based on Project Needs:** Decide whether to use rebasing or merging based on project requirements and team preferences.
