### Remote Branches Cheatsheet

#### Remote References and Remote-Tracking Branches:
- **Remote References:** Pointers in remote repositories, including branches and tags.
- **Remote-Tracking Branches:** Local references representing the state of remote branches.
- **Naming Convention:** `<remote>/<branch>` (e.g., `origin/master`).
- **Fetch Command:** `git fetch <remote>` updates remote-tracking branches.

#### Adding Remote Servers and Fetching:
- **Adding Remote:** Use `git remote add <shortname> <url>` to add a remote server.
- **Fetching Data:** `git fetch <remote>` fetches data from the remote server.

#### Pushing to Remotes:
- **Push Command:** `git push <remote> <branch>` shares a local branch with a remote.
- **Branch Naming:** Shortcut for push: `<remote>/<branch>:<branch>` (e.g., `git push origin serverfix:serverfix`).
- **Credential Cache:** Set up credential caching for HTTPS authentication to avoid typing password repeatedly.

#### Tracking Branches:
- **Tracking Branches:** Local branches directly related to remote branches.
- **Setting Up Tracking:** Automatically created when checking out from a remote-tracking branch.
- **Shortcut:** `git checkout --track <remote>/<branch>` creates a tracking branch.
- **Renaming:** Use `-b` option to set up a local branch with a different name than the remote branch.

#### Checking Tracking Branches:
- **View Tracking Branches:** Use `git branch -vv` to see local branches and their tracking status.
- **Ahead/Behind:** Indicates commits ahead or behind the remote branch.
- **Refresh Tracking Info:** Fetch from all remotes before checking tracking branches (`git fetch --all`).

#### Pulling Changes:
- **Pull Command:** `git pull` fetches changes and merges them into the current branch.
- **Explicit Fetch and Merge:** Recommended for clarity and control.

#### Deleting Remote Branches:
- **Delete Command:** `git push <remote> --delete <branch>` removes a remote branch.
- **Garbage Collection:** Deleted branches are kept until garbage collection runs, making recovery easy if accidentally deleted.
