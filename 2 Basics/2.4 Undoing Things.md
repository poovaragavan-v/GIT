### Undoing Changes in Git

#### Amending Commits
**Scenario:** Committed too early, forgot files, or need to fix a commit message.

1. Make additional changes and stage them:
   ```sh
   $ git add forgotten_file
   ```

2. Amend the last commit:
   ```sh
   $ git commit --amend
   ```
   - Opens commit-message editor with the previous commit message.
   - Results in a single, updated commit, replacing the old one.

**Important:** Only amend commits that are local and not pushed. Amending pushed commits and force pushing can cause problems for collaborators.

#### Unstaging a Staged File
**Scenario:** Accidentally staged files you don't want to commit yet.

1. Stage files:
   ```sh
   $ git add *
   ```

2. Check status:
   ```sh
   $ git status
   ```

3. Unstage specific file using `git reset`:
   ```sh
   $ git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```
   - The file remains modified but is no longer staged.

**Alternative with `git restore`:**
1. Unstage specific file:
   ```sh
   $ git restore --staged CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

#### Unmodifying a Modified File
**Scenario:** Revert changes in a file back to the last committed state.

1. Check status:
   ```sh
   $ git status
   ```

2. Revert changes using `git checkout`:
   ```sh
   $ git checkout -- CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

**Alternative with `git restore`:**
1. Revert changes:
   ```sh
   $ git restore CONTRIBUTING.md
   ```

**Warning:** `git checkout -- <file>` and `git restore <file>` will discard local changes. Only use if you're sure you don't need those changes.

#### Summary of Commands
- **Amend last commit:**
