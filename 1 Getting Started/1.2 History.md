### Getting Started - A Short History of Git

#### A Short History of Git

Git's inception is a story of necessity and innovation, emerging from a period of contention within the open-source community.

**Early Linux Kernel Development (1991–2002)**
- **Process:** Changes were shared via patches and archived files.
- **Challenge:** The growing complexity of the Linux kernel necessitated a more robust version control system.

**BitKeeper Era (2002–2005)**
- **Tool:** The Linux kernel project adopted BitKeeper, a proprietary Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
- **Issue:** In 2005, a fallout between the Linux community and BitKeeper's developers led to the revocation of its free usage.

**Birth of Git (2005)**
- **Catalyst:** The termination of BitKeeper's free status spurred Linus Torvalds and the Linux development community to create a new version control system.
- **Goals:**
  - **Speed:** Prioritize rapid performance.
  - **Simple Design:** Ensure a straightforward architecture.
  - **Support for Non-linear Development:** Facilitate thousands of parallel branches.
  - **Distribution:** Enable a fully distributed system.
  - **Efficiency:** Manage large projects like the Linux kernel with ease.

**Evolution of Git**
- Since 2005, Git has developed into a user-friendly yet powerful tool, maintaining its foundational goals:
  - **Speed:** Remains incredibly fast.
  - **Efficiency:** Handles large projects effectively.
  - **Branching System:** Supports complex, non-linear workflows with ease.
