### Understanding Git

#### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Unlike other version control systems, Git thinks about data as snapshots of a filesystem rather than as changes to individual files.

#### Key Concepts and Terminology

1. **Snapshots, Not Differences**
   - **Traditional VCS:** Stores information as a list of file-based changes (delta-based version control).
   - **Git:** Stores data as snapshots of the entire project. Each commit is a snapshot of all files at that moment. Unchanged files are linked to previous identical files.

2. **Nearly Every Operation Is Local**
   - Most operations require only local resources.
   - No network latency; operations are almost instantaneous.
   - You can work offline or without a VPN connection.

3. **Git Has Integrity**
   - Everything is checksummed using a SHA-1 hash before storage.
   - Ensures data integrity and prevents undetected corruption.
   - Git references data by its hash value rather than by file name.

4. **Git Generally Only Adds Data**
   - Actions in Git mostly add data.
   - It is difficult to lose committed data, providing a safety net for experimentation.

#### The Three States of Git Files

1. **Modified:** You have changed the file but have not committed it to the database yet.
2. **Staged:** You have marked a modified file to be included in the next commit.
3. **Committed:** The data is safely stored in your local Git database.

#### Main Sections of a Git Project

1. **Working Tree:**
   - A single checkout of one version of the project.
   - Files here are pulled out of the compressed database for use or modification.

2. **Staging Area:**
   - Also called the "index."
   - Stores information about what will go into the next commit.
   - Acts as a preparation area for changes to be committed.

3. **Git Directory:**
   - Contains the metadata and object database for your project.
   - This is the core of Git, and it's what gets copied when you clone a repository.

#### Basic Git Workflow

1. **Modify Files:** Work on files in your working tree.
2. **Stage Changes:** Selectively stage changes to be included in the next commit.
3. **Commit:** Save a snapshot of the files in the staging area to the Git directory.

#### Commands Summary

- **Check Status:** `git status` – Check the status of your files in the working tree.
- **Add to Staging Area:** `git add <file>` – Stage changes for the next commit.
- **Commit Changes:** `git commit -m "message"` – Commit changes in the staging area with a message.
- **View History:** `git log` – View the history of commits.
- **Clone Repository:** `git clone <url>` – Clone a repository to your local machine.
- **Push Changes:** `git push` – Push local commits to the remote repository.
- **Pull Changes:** `git pull` – Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository.

#### Understanding Git Branching

- **Branches:** Git supports non-linear development through branches.
- **Create Branch:** `git branch <branch-name>` – Create a new branch.
- **Switch Branch:** `git checkout <branch-name>` – Switch to a different branch.
- **Merge Branch:** `git merge <branch-name>` – Merge a branch into your current branch.
