1. **Private Small Team Workflow:**
   - Collaborate on a closed-source project with simple Git workflows.
   - Developers push changes to a shared repository, handle merges locally.
   - Each developer clones the repository, works on a feature, then pushes changes.

2. **Private Managed Team Workflow:**
   - Larger private groups work on features in team-based branches.
   - Integration managers handle merging branches into the main repository.
   - Developers collaborate in parallel on different features, merging changes upstream.

3. **Forked Public Project Workflow:**
   - Developers contribute via forked repositories in public projects.
   - Clone the main repository, create a feature branch, and push changes to a personal fork.
   - Submit pull requests to the maintainers, who review and merge the changes.

4. **Public Project over Email Workflow:**
   - Developers create topic branches for patches and generate patch series.
   - Send patches via email or use Git's `git send-email` command.
   - Maintainers review and integrate the patches into the project.
