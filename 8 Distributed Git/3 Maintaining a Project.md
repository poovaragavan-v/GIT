1. **Working in Topic Branches**: Topic branches are temporary branches used to try out new work. They allow for easy experimentation and isolation of changes. Naming conventions such as `theme/description` or `contributor/theme/description` can help keep branches organized.

2. **Applying Patches from Email**: Patches received via email can be applied using `git apply` or `git am`. `git apply` is used for patches generated with `git diff`, while `git am` is used for patches generated with `git format-patch`.

3. **Checking Out Remote Branches**: Remote branches can be checked out locally after adding the remote repository. This allows for testing and integrating changes made by other contributors.

4. **Integrating Contributed Work**: There are different workflows for integrating contributed work, such as merging directly into the master branch, using a two-phase merge cycle with master and develop branches, or maintaining separate long-running branches like in the Git project.

5. **Rerere**: Rerere (reuse recorded resolution) can be enabled to automate conflict resolution during merges and rebases, saving time for maintainers.

6. **Tagging Your Releases**: Tags can be assigned to releases for easy reference. Signing tags with PGP keys provides additional security and verification.

7. **Generating a Build Number**: `git describe` can be used to generate a human-readable name for commits, consisting of the most recent tag, commit count since the tag, and abbreviated commit hash.

8. **Preparing a Release**: Releases can be prepared by creating archives of the latest snapshot using `git archive`, and generating changelogs using `git shortlog` to summarize commits since the last release.
